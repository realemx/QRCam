## QRCam

QRCam is a webcam QR Code Scanner based on OpenCV. 
I needed one and didn't find something like this so I quickly made one for myself.
 
## Build

You'll need OpenCV and CMake installed.
Just run these commands inside the qrcam directory to build the code:

```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ ./qrcam
```
